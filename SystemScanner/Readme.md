This set of scripts (script1.py and temp.py) is aimed at mining the maximum amount of information from a given system,
and piping the output to a json file (in case of script1.py) and to the screen (in case of temp.py)
1. **script1.py** - Intends to get as much physical and OS data from the system as possible.
2. **temp.py** - Returns all the information of all running processes on the system. An update to convert this data to json shall be coming soon.
